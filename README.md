# MY MMO RPG


## Epitech C Project
This project is based on the first-year epitech subject "my-rpg". It requires 4 people to design and develop an RPG using C over a period of 1 month.  The project uses the CSFML version of the SFML library. It implements a network system to get closer to the MMO-RPG concept.
